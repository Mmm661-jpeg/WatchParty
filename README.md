# ðŸŽ¬ Streaming Watch Party App

A real-time application to host and join watch parties with synced video playback, chat, and room management â€” built as a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.

---

## Overview

This app enables users to create and join virtual watch parties where video playback is synchronized across participants in real time. It features user authentication, room management, chat, and video proxying, all coordinated via microservices with robust backend infrastructure.

## Architecture

- Microservices backend deployed on **Azure Container Apps** for easy scaling and management
- Frontend hosted as an Azure **Static Web App** or on Azure Container Apps
- Docker used for environment consistency across development and deployment
- YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) provides lightweight routing, auth control, and rate limiting
- Mix of SQL (MSSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases depending on service needs
- gRPC streaming used for high-performance sync in SyncService

---

## Development

- Clone repo and build using Visual Studio or `dotnet` CLI
- Shared protobuf definitions for microservice communication in `/sharedprotos`
- Environment configs managed via `.Template.json` files to avoid leaking secrets

---

## Notes on gRPC and SignalR Usage

The **SyncService** supports both SignalR and gRPC streaming protocols to keep video playback synchronized across all participants in a room. SignalR provides easy integration with Blazor and web clients, while gRPC streaming can be used for more performant backend-to-backend or server-to-server synchronization.
